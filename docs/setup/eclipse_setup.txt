Basic project setup:
	1. Start eclipse
	2. Create a new C-Project
	3. Select "ARM Cross Target Application" with toolchain "ARM Linux GCC (Summon)" and give it a name
	4. Finish
	5. Project is created. If you are asked if you want to switch to the C/C++ perspective you can answer with "Yes"
	6. Now you start copying a bunch of files to get the basic project structure. Just import the 01_blink project instead of creating a new one and modify that.

Debugging (should work with st-util instead of OpenOCD, too):
	1. Install "C/C++ GDB Hardware Debugging" plugin
	2. Install openocd
	3. Create new "GDB Hardware Debugging" debug configuration in eclipse project
	4. Tab "Debugger":
		- Change GDB command to: "arm-none-eabi-gdb"
		- Change port number to 3333
	5. Tab "Startup":
		- Enter the following in "Run commands":
			monitor reset init
			c
	6. Tab "Common":
		- Tick at "Debug" in the "Display in favorites menu" box
	7. Click "Apply" -> "Close"
	8. Set a breakpoint somewhere
	9. Launch openocd like so:
		openocd -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f4x_stlink.cfg
	10. Choose the created debug configuration from the debug drop-down menu in eclipse
    11. You may have to right-click the thread in the Debug view and select Restart for brakepoints to work
